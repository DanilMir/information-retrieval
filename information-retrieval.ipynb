      "1. I really like this game, For the people thinking about playing it, I'd suggest you to do one thing as I did. Don't play the logical way you think will benefit you the most and make you to 'win' this game. Play it the way as you were the person who got these chances, play it like YOU were the faust, when I did it, I figured out, I would die. Isn't that nice? :)  Graphics looks good the only thing I find that is bad is that I can't play this game in windowed mode, but it seems like it's running in borderless mode so Alt+tabbing is working without any problems.  On the other side, audio is really bad, it seems like it's lagging but that may be my problem only. Characters are not talking, only subtitles are there, but I don't really mind it.  This game is very short when you play it only once but I believe this game is not meant to be played only once, considering every action you do changes the story. First time I played this game I finished it in 40 minutes, second playtime I finished in 30 minutes. And I'm not bored yet, I will play this game when achievements will be working.  So if you ask me, I highly suggest you this game, :)\n",

      "1. Interesting game, although a bit quirky. Not much replayability as of yet. Once you finish the campaign, you can either replay it and lose your previous save data or well...read the comic... It'd be nice for a different way to play the game such as a sandbox mode or some other point of view... All I can say is, if I and another officer refused to go on a call at my job, we would be relieved of duty effective immediately... Happens pretty frequently in this game though... Still the story is decent.\n",

      "2.  Early Access Review\n",
      "3. This game is fanny\n",
      "4. This game asks one simple question: Can you build a nation that will stand the test of time?  Its not an easy question to work out 'yes' to if you're looking for a challenge. The AI might be random at times or it might be entirely logical, But from playing it I've learned you should always keep on your toes. Outside of easy, the computer players can outmatch you but not just militarily - unless you hit the ground running you can be quickly overshadowed.  This incarnation of the Civilization franchise makes a lot of changes, namely the switch from a grid to hexagons and the removal of the ability to stack units. Some people loathe this but after playing it i've found the whole thing less of a meatgrinder; no throwing your army at a stack of 23 armies on one square, no 31+ stack of armies lying in wait when you attack an enemy city. In fact the system makes it more viable and likely to surround a city (which is what happened in most wars by the way) rather than charge headlong at it with a bulk army. Every detail of the world is beautifully rendered, sometimes I found myself panning the camera over my and my enemies' civs imagining what life is like in the piece of Earth they have carved out.  Gods and Kings and Brave New World - its epansions - at a ton of variety to the game. The culture victory option for example, involves tourism and cultural influence, which is how places like America, Japan and the UK ingrain their cultural mannerisms elsewhere in the real world.  The game is not just beautiful on a strategic level; I'm a fan of history and culture and this game is bursting at the seams with it, especially with Brave New World; every technology has an associated quote be it a passage of a holy book, a line from a Greek, Roman or Shakesperian play or a phrase coined by a legendary person. Every world wonder you complete shows you an oil-on-canvas painting of it complete with a quote that relates to its purpose or its reputation, in the second expansion your great people can world-renowned paintings and compositions which you, the player, can enjoy for yourself. It makes you want to build wonders even more if this is your kind of thing.  Whether you're an empire builder at heart, passionate for history, love high culture or just enjoy watching burning everything to the ground. This is a worthy addition to the franchise so get this, get the expansions too (even if you're nonreligions, Gods and Kings adds a lot of other stuff to the game), this game would be ideal for you.  Just don't expect to be done in a three-hour session; Civ is not a game for the twitch player. Its famous for that.\n",

      "2. This is a game whose core idea is surprisingly sound, and more compelling than I thought it would be, but is implemented into a game that's constantly at cross-purposes with itself. Your vehicle upgrades matter more than your agility, and as you start with the most upgradeable one, there's no reason to ever use or upgrade another. While there are tracks that show they know how to give you -just- enough of a view to quickly react, all too many contain spots where you literally cannot see what's oncoming. There's a reverse-your-controls debuff that's leaned on entirely too much, and that reverses your boost and brake buttons in a way that knocks you out of the game (given you otherwise just hold down boost at all times). Buying gate keys and track info is completely pointless, and 'gold' times and tantalum are just the same thing (that is, the tantalum you get is just based on finish time, and the time needed to get all the tantalum is the same as the gold time).  Oh, and the gates are the four usual suspect colors, with no way to change 'em. If you're red-green colorblind, it will be a problem.  Dodging gates is surprisingly fun. Get into it, get a good streak going and you feel like a ninja, it's awesome. And those moments are much rarer than they should be, due to several elements of the game's design. Honestly, it's not worth it.\n",
